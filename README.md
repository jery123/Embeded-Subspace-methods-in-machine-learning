# Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction  
## **Using Embedded and Subspace Methods**

---

### 🚀 **Project Overview**  
This project explores two essential machine learning techniques: **Embedded Methods** and **Subspace Methods**. These methods are powerful tools for improving model performance, reducing overfitting, and enhancing computational efficiency.  

---

## 🔍 **Description**  

### **1. Embedded Methods**  
Embedded Methods perform **feature selection** during the model training process. These methods combine feature selection and model building into one step, optimizing the process.  
- Techniques include:  
   - **LASSO Regression** (L1 Regularization)  
   - **Tree-based Models** (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  

### **2. Subspace Methods**  
Subspace Methods focus on **dimensionality reduction** by transforming the original feature space into lower-dimensional subspaces. These methods help in reducing data redundancy and computational costs.  
- Techniques include:  
   - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
   - **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
